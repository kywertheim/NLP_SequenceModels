# NLP_SequenceModels

Context: I completed these guided programming exercises during the Coursera course entitled 'Natural Language Processing with Sequence Models'.

1. C3_W1_Assignment.ipynb:
This notebook records the steps taken to build a deep neural network (feedforward) for sentiment analysis.

2. C3_W2_Assignment.ipynb:
This notebook presents a recurrent neural network with gated recurrent units. It works as a deep n-grams language model to predict the next set of characters using the previous characters in a sentence. The model is evaluated using the perplexity score.

3. C3_W3_Assignment.ipynb:
This notebook presents a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, which locates and classifies named entities in a sentence (named entity recognition).

4. C3_W4_Assignment.ipynb:
This notebook records the steps taken to build a Siamese network comprising two LSTM subnetworks to identify duplicate questions, including using the triplet loss function to train the network.
